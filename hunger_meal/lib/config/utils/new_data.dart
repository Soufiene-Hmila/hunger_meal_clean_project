        "Saudi F&B Hero: Co-founder and CEO of MFC, Faisal Shaker",
        """
Entrepreneur, restaurateur and visionary co-founder and CEO of Saudi-based F&B firm MFC, Faisal Shaker is a true Saudi F&B Hero. With over 23 years of experience across different sectors, his journey in F&B started back in 2009, when he decided, along with his partners, to launch homegrown fine-dining restaurants in Riyadh. MFC has been operating international franchise brands since 2014.

Since then, the impressive portfolio of brands under MFC includes the Venetian-inspired Cicchetti, F1 legend Flavio Briatore’s elite entertainment spot, Billionaire, the award-winning Peruvian-Japanese restaurant COYA, Italian restaurant Signor Sassi, as well as the aforementioned homegrown award-winning concept, contemporary Japanese restaurant, MYAZU.

There is also the company’s delivery service-style brand Kayzo, in addition to the recent openings of the sleek and playful new dining concept Crazy Pizza and the globally renowned Monte Carlo’s stylish Beefbar. Also under MFC group is the franchise of Urth Caffe in the GCC region which has been operating for more than 30 years and originates from Los Angeles.

One of many MFC’s proud achievements is the Saudi-born concept MYAZU which stood tall among many international restaurants at the inaugural MENA’s 50 Best Restaurants Awards. It was rated number one in Saudi and 15th across the MENA region just one year after launching. Shaker is behind one of the very first Saudi brands to have such a strong global presence and has helped MFC become a top reputable brand across the world.

Over the last year, MYAZU in both Riyadh and Jeddah has played host to high calibre VIP guests, as well as loyal guests who visit the restaurant regularly for its high-quality culinary experience, top service and great atmosphere.

Shaker said to Caterer Middle East: “At MFC, everything revolves around three key pillars, our people, our guest’s experience and finally our products. All of our business actions are dictated by our passion for great ideas, contemporary artistic lifestyles and modern entertainment. We are passionate ambassadors of the brands we represent, and our objective is to always stay ahead of our guest’s expectations. There has been a strong focus on forging strong relationships with business partners and creating high-performing brands with the best people delivering the best customer service in the market.

“Our mission is to make passion our currency, relationships our bottom line and trust our trademark. While, our vision is to promote happiness using an environment of quality, sincerity and humanity through the oldest form of social gatherings, a good meal.”

Prior to being the CEO and co-founder of MFC Group, Shaker was in the banking and investment industry for over 15 years, where he served several roles in corporate banking, investment banking and multiple managerial positions, at different places, starting in Merrill Lynch, SABB, Barclays and Audi Capital. Moreover, Shaker also sits on different boards and committees and chairs some of them, including three boards for publicly listed companies.

According to the ambitious leader, success in F&B is more than statistics. He explained: “We set out to define the region’s industry practices and create market benchmarks of international standards. We believe in long-term business relationships that are based on mutual goals, ethical business practices and the single-minded pursuit of delivering the extraordinary. We are true to ourselves and others. We are honest in our dealings. We aim to deliver the best and make it better. We offer an excellent experience.”

Looking ahead, Shaker plans to expand MFC’s Tokyo-inspired Robata restaurant and Alto, an Italian dining concept from London. One of many main goals for MFC is to continue contributing to Saudi Vision 2030 and its program “quality of life” in addition to being a prominent leader in the tourism and hospitality industry and contributing to the country’s vision and growth by setting a renowned example to the world.
